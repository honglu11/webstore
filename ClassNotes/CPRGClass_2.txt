Class 2: Chris.Elias@sait.ca
Paackage name: use period, always lower case, can make long as you want, in file system it required limited path length so be careful. if has 255 chars directory combination, won't be able to deleted it. unless you connect to network and combine to your file, then can delete it.canot put number in the package.

Class name: start with Capital follow with lower case. The second word will capital then lower cases. Cannot use Underscore.The file name should be the same as the java class.

default: private only own class can see it.
protected: children can see it.
public: every one can see it.

public class Shirt -> Modifier class class name
Declare the field on the top of the class.

public String description = "This is a description."; - modifier type variable name, won't use public in real life, since don't want to be munipulate.
Java does not know String since String is not a primitive type. 

primitive type: char, short, int, long, double, float, boolean.

variable: cannot start with number.

public char colourCode = 'U'; ( char is single character: can not colourCode = 'UA')
har colourCode = 24; 

java consisten field with angular, or other system. 
Method name: cannot have underscore, cannot Capital of the first word. ( experience developer will let you fix it ), when change a method to a private, a waring will comes out if nobody use this method. if no use, just delete it. 

a sentence always end with semicoloumn. code format is very important for the functionality.

what is the impact of performance of the code?

inbetween * is not importance but easy for developer to know it is comments. Documentation the java automatically.
/**
  This is a comment.
*/

documentation: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html

	// Methods ( never show in Documentation )
	
the following will show in Documentation
	/**
	 * Displays information about our shirt
	 */

static main is the start point of the application

final Shirt shirt = new Shirt();
Shirt shirt = new Shirt(); will get error

Shirt shirt;
shirt = new Shirt();
shirt = new Shirt(); will be ok since Shirt is not final. but if not final, if reassign has something wrong cannot debug.

Shirt Shirt = new Shirt(); confusing don't know which one is variable, which one is class. vaiable start with lower character.

Class 3:

=======================================

Maven Project: publish to internet if use company group id, artifact id, if use fake one, will not publish if nobody get access.
package: jar - standalone app(web application), pom - , war - 

.m2 
C:\Users\honglu\.m2\repository\log4j\log4j\1.2.12
has checksum file: log4j-1.2.12.jar.sha1

continue integration - make change version control, env make a build, not use maven, download the build, build the code automatically. 

objects: can only extend one class
Beverage: coffee, icetea, ( attributese: size, price, name )

Books books, name, author, isbn, price, format
Product lego,  name, price

by default, all class come from Object

if there is no extends, by default it extends from Object like

public class Item extends Object {
}

 head ( problem use sequnce number as primary key to merge data to head office, use uuid as primary key instead.
store1(sequence 1,2,3) store2( sequence 1,2,3, .. )

ItemImpl      product

Harvest - get into inventory -> take raw stuff -> turn to material -> become product -> go to inventory
